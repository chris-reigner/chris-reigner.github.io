<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Read the blog here: [TODO]

This repository aims at giving any reader the ability to become of Full Stack ML engineer.
I mean to be a full stack ML Engineer when considering the wild ecosystem of Data and Computer Science across all fields.
Some parts of the repository focuses on Natural Language Processing that became LLM driven in the recent years.
A specific focus that came to my attention is the MLOps and LLMOps field.

The repo is not an extensive deep dive into each concept but rather an overview of what is needed to become full stack.
There are links shared towards other blogs and notebooks when a topic needs to be deep dived or when I found the resources to be amazing for someone who wants to learn.

I've created this repo so people (including myself) can have a central place to cover these many topics, keep learning and keep improving through time.
I've tried to make topics accessible but most of them require already a great level of what data and computer science is.
I've tried as much as possible to relay ML/LLM Ops practices, give real life (i.e. enterprise) experiences and feedbacks to go beyond the theory.

It may be incomplete, work in progress as I keep updating it.
Sometimes AI assistants helped me writing or reviewing it.

Ping me if you want to add any contribution to it or if you have any comments.

Have fun reading it !
