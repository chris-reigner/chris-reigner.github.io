# About the author

Hello! Probably the hardest page to write !

I'm a French statistical engineer who has spent nearly a decade modeling financial markets. 
While it was an exciting journey, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) opened up a whole new world 
of possibilities.
My professional journey has taken me from the statistical methods of the 1970s to the cutting-edge realm 
of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a future that, who knows, might one day become a reality. 
Throughout my career, I've explored a wide array of topics across different times, industries, and regions of the world.
I am passionate about AI and eager to understand how things work. Additionally, I am equally enthusiastic
about people and enjoy spending time explaining and sharing knowledge with various generations. 

My curiosity about the next frontier of AI drives me to apply this knowledge to practical applications 
within enterprises.
I've had the opportunity to work in diverse fields such as Investment Banking, entrepreneurship, and Insurance, 
spanning across Europe. My transition from financial engineering to AI agents engineering has been both 
challenging and rewarding.
This blog is my attempt to provide a window into the AI world, helping readers go beyond the surface. 
While there are many excellent blogs available on specific topics, I aim to create a continuity between these topics based on my unique experiences. I hope you find the content insightful and engaging!

Thank you for visiting!
